# SAT

This is my implementation of SAT collision detection.

- Created custom Polygon object to allow creating your own custom convex polygons given initial points.
- allow user to move cardinal directions and ability to rotate polygon clockwise and counter clockwise
- draw normals (not normalized) of each edge of every polygon
- changes color if collision detected
